MVP web application for a product called "Discy Bio"
The app allows users to upload data which is then processed and tagged/labeled/classified using AI.
The tagged/labeled/classified data is then available for the user to create reports against.
The user can update/refresh these reports easily as new data is uploaded.
The app uses a mix of code and no/low-code to accelerate build, refinement and ultimately TTM
